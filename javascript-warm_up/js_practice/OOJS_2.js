// In this task we provide you with the start of a definition for a Shape class. It has three properties: name, sides, and sideLength. This class only models shapes for which all sides are the same length, like a square or an equilateral triangle.

// We'd like you to:

// Add a constructor to this class. The constructor takes arguments for the name, sides, and sideLength properties, and initializes them.
// Add a new method calcPerimeter() method to the class, which calculates its perimeter (the length of the shape's outer edge) and logs the result to the console.
// Create a new instance of the Shape class called square. Give it a name of square, 4 sides, and a sideLength of 5.
// Call your calcPerimeter() method on the instance, to see whether it logs the calculation result to the browser's console as expected.
// Create a new instance of Shape called triangle, with a name of triangle, 3 sides and a sideLength of 3.
// Call triangle.calcPerimeter() to check that it works OK.


// OOJS_2

// Next we'd like you to create a Square class that inherits from Shape, and adds a calcArea() 
// method that calculates the square's area. Also set up the constructor so that the name property of 
// Square object instances is automatically set to square, and the sides property is automatically set to 4. 
// When invoking the constructor, you should therefore just need to provide the sideLength property.

// Create an instance of the Square class called square with appropriate property values, and call its calcPerimeter() 
// and calcArea() methods to show that it works OK.

class Shape {

    name;
    sides;
    sideLength;

    constructor(name, sides, sideLength) {
        this.name = name;
        this.sides = sides;
        this.sideLength = sideLength;
    }

    calcPerimeter() {
        const perimeter = this.sides * this.sideLength;
        console.log(`Perimeter of ${this.name} is ${perimeter}`);
    }

}

class Square extends Shape {

    constructor(sideLength) {
        super('square', 4, sideLength);
    }

    calcArea() {
        const area = this.sideLength * this.sideLength;
        console.log(`Area of ${this.name} is ${area}`);
    }
}

const square = new Square(4);
square.calcPerimeter();
square.calcArea()
// const square = new Shape('square', 4, 5);
// square.calcPerimeter();

// const triangle = new Shape('triangle', 3, 3);
// triangle.calcPerimeter();
