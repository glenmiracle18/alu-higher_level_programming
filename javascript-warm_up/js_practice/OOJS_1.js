// In this task we provide you with the start of a definition for a Shape class. It has three properties: name, sides, and sideLength. This class only models shapes for which all sides are the same length, like a square or an equilateral triangle.

// We'd like you to:

// Add a constructor to this class. The constructor takes arguments for the name, sides, and sideLength properties, and initializes them.
// Add a new method calcPerimeter() method to the class, which calculates its perimeter (the length of the shape's outer edge) and logs the result to the console.
// Create a new instance of the Shape class called square. Give it a name of square, 4 sides, and a sideLength of 5.
// Call your calcPerimeter() method on the instance, to see whether it logs the calculation result to the browser's console as expected.
// Create a new instance of Shape called triangle, with a name of triangle, 3 sides and a sideLength of 3.
// Call triangle.calcPerimeter() to check that it works OK.

class Shape {

    name;
    sides;
    sideLength;

    constructor(name, sides, sideLength) {
        this.name = name;
        this.sides = sides;
        this.sideLength = sideLength;
    }

    calcPerimeter() {
        const perimeter = this.sides * this.sideLength;
        console.log(`Perimeter of ${this.name} is ${perimeter}`);
    }

}


const square = new Shape('square', 4, 5);
square.calcPerimeter();

const triangle = new Shape('triangle', 3, 3);
triangle.calcPerimeter();
